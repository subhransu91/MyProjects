Run Pacifist War.py from IDLE.

It will open up a window with a greeting, "Welcome to Pacifist War!"

It will then ask you to type 'Start' and press enter to begin the game.

Once the game starts, the message on the screen will show the initial scores to be 0 each and in the next line will say,"Welcome to Round 1:","Type 'Hit' and press enter to draw the cards:".

From here, everytime you type and enter "Hit" the computer will pick 2 cards in random and show it to you and accordingly it will show you the updated score with whoever having the higher rank scoring 1 point.

This goes on for 26 rounds and at the end if the user has the cumulative score, he/she wins the game and for that a message is showed saying,"Wow! you won!"

If the user loses in the end, a message is displayed saying,"Sorry, you lost!".

The program then ends.

Thanks for a great semester, Professor. I wish you all the joy and happiness for the holidays and the next year.
