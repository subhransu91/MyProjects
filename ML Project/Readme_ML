## Should the loan be Approved?

This paper looks at a vast dataset (almost 900,000 instances) of historical loan approvals and their default rates, in order to predict whether an SBA loan should be approved or denied based on the loanâ€™s default risk profile assessed from SBA loan data. The dataset was acquired from the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA), which acts as an insurer for bank loans to small businesses. After cleaning the data, different methodologies were used to determine which variables play significant roles in determining the credit worthiness of a loan. Different machine learning algorithms like logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors (k-NN), and support vector machines were used to design and evaluate a predictive model for loan approval. The best prediction accuracy is 0.9957 with Kernel SVM with a linear kernel. Compared with logistic regression and k-nearest neighbors, kernel SVM is a better prediction model for this dataset.
