## GreenGo

GreenGo is a fun educational and interaction game to motivate and incentivize users to properly recycle alkaline batteries for IOS and Android phone users. Users will set up an account, create an avatar then enter the game through a map which is the user's geographical location, or the user could change it to augmented reality (AR) mode. 
GreenGo will alert its users every time they pass by a battery collection point. When the users bring their used batteries to the collection site then take a picture of their batteries using the phone camera, they activate a bunny hunt game, which will give them points. Each bunny collected is 1 point. For every 20 points accumulated, users will be able to redeem a coupon to various eco-friendly products/coupons of their choice, level up in the game and potentially open more features to get more points.
